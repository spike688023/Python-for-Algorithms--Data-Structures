    "\n",
    "A tower has 100 floors. You've been given two eggs. The eggs are strong enough that they can be dropped from a particular floor in the tower without breaking. You've been tasked to find the highest floor an egg can be dropped without breaking, in as few drops as possible. If an egg is dropped from above its target floor it will break. If it is dropped from that floor or below, it will be intact and you can test drop the egg again on another floor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Show algorithmically how you would go about doing this in as few drops as possible. (Your answer should be a number of the fewest drops needed for testing 2 eggs on 100 floors)"
