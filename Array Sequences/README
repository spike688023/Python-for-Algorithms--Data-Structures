好奇 list vs tuple:
Tuples are fixed size in nature whereas lists are dynamic.
In other words, a tuple is immutable whereas a list is mutable.

You can't add elements to a tuple. Tuples have no append or extend method.
You can't remove elements from a tuple. Tuples have no remove or pop method.
You can find elements in a tuple, since this doesn’t change the tuple.
You can also use the in operator to check if an element exists in the tuple


list,tuple, and string objects are "sequence" type object classes available in Python.

The main commonaility between these object types is the ability to index to access individual elements in the sequence.
